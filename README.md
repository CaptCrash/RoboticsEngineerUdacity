# RoboticsEngineerUdacity
This repository contains projects for the Udacity Robotics Engineering Course.
Currently the structure is:

/workspaceL1/myrobot/->Files and folders for the first project (setting up a gazebo world)

/catkin_ws/ -> Files and folders for the "ball chaser" project"

/catkin_WhereAmI/ -> Files and folders for the "Where Am I" project

/catkin_mapmyworld/ ->Files and folders for the "Map My World" project


Note, the projects tend to have you grab previos repos, so many files will be repeated from previous projects.
